Code for technical test.

Code will run from index.html without needing to 'run npm start' but that can also be run, which will start a server running on localhost:3001.

Code is in src and compiled in dist folders.

I have used Preact (js) on this project because it is similar enough to React that I don't have to learn too much anew but also because I wanted the resulting JS bundle to be small.

I have used SASS (css) on this project because I wanted to show my knowledge of preprocessors is estabilished and that I'm happy to use SASS.

I attempted to write in BEM standard but I apprecitate if I did not follow the finer requirements to be fully compliant with that methodology.
